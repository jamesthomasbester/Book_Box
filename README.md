# Book Shelf

## Description

an e-commerce storefront which allows users to select and add books to a cart & checkout. Through their personal account creation they would be able to save their personal choices for future visits as well as favourites to serve as a wishlist.

This sort of app is lacking for most readers in the current age without the app including other products which can make the user experience more cluttered or confusing.

As a moviegoer, I want to know what good books to read, i want to see reviews, ratings & synopses as well as save them to favourites on my personal account, add them to a cart and be able to checkout for purchase.

### Functionality

Once the user creates an account and logs in, they are able to navigate using the navbar and the search function to find books they might want to purchase. They can see more information about individual books including reviews, ratings & synopses. 

Once they have decided they wish to purchase a book they can add it to the cart, they can continue browsing or choose to checkout.

If they are not logged in they will be redirected and asked to signup.
